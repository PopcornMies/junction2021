This is an idea built on the improving meeting experiences for all participants by using analytics to evaluate the positivity and activity levels of meetings. 

Although the demo doesn't directly interact with Miro, it is built on the idea that if an interface that allowed for fetching the 
speech or transcript of speech from meetings conducted in Miro or other meeting platforms, the speech could be parsed and overall meeting sentiment and 
activity level of participants could be evaluated and the analysis could be used to create better meetings for everyone.
